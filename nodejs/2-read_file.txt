Using the database "database.csv" (provided in project description), create a function "countStudents" in the file 2-read_file.js

Create a function named "countStudents". It should accept a path in argument
The script should attempt to read the database file synchronously
If the database is not available, it should throw an error with the text "Cannot load the database"
If the database is available, it should log the following message to the console "Number of students: NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS"
It should log the number of students in each field, and the list with the following format: "Number of students in FIELD: 6. List: LIST_OF_FIRSTNAMES"
CSV file can contain empty lines (at the end) - and they are not a valid student!
bob@dylan:~$ cat 2-main_0.js
const countStudents = require('./2-read_file');

countStudents("nope.csv");

bob@dylan:~$ node 2-main_0.js

    throw new Error('Cannot load the database');
